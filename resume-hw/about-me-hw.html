		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<img src="img/me.jpg">
      <p>I'm an Indian-American woman, born and raised in the South Bay. I graduated with a degree in English literature with an emphasis in Critical Theory and a minor in Spanish from the University of California Irvine. After living in Southern California for nearly 5 years, I moved back up to the Bay to work in content and grant writing. After a couple years, during a trip to India, I decided to stay in Delhi for about 6 months just cuz. Then, upon returning, I got a position at a real estate firm doing print media marketing, where I learned Photoshop! Now I'm venturing out into new fields because my passions are diverse and I think I could be a badass full-stack developer.</p>
      <p>In my free time I enjoy playing video games! Before 2015, I'd never played anything besides Mario Kart (twice) but now they are something I enjoy and excel at! Currently my favorite games are The Division, BroForce, Amplitude, and Cosmophony. I also love reading, going to the beach, watching TV shows, and consuming popular culture. And I love traveling! The last place I went to was NYC and my next big plan is to go to Paris/London or Tokyo!</p>
